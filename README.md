MemprofLite
===========

This is a memory profiler that intercepts every malloc/free calls and records them. This can be used to profile both C/C++ applications. You just need to link to the shared library and you are ready to profile your application. If you do not want to profile your application always, then you can use appropriate API's to start/stop the profiler.
